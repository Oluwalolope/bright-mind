## Project Overview
The **Bright Mind** landing page was designed to provide a vibrant and engaging online presence for the brand. It focuses on clean design, intuitive navigation, and responsiveness across various devices.

## Features
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
- Interactive elements built with React JS.
- Clear and modern UI/UX, focusing on user engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **React JS**: For building the user interface.
- **React Hooks**: Particularly `useRef` and `useState`, to manage component state and references.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and ensuring responsiveness.

## Challenges and Learning
### Deployment
Deploying the project and handling static assets were particularly challenging aspects. Due to the intricacies of GitHub Pages and React's routing, ensuring that assets loaded correctly required extensive research and troubleshooting. However, with persistence, these challenges were successfully overcome.

### React Hooks
Throughout the development process, I deepened my understanding of React Hooks, particularly `useRef` and `useState`. These tools were instrumental in managing component states and DOM references efficiently.
